# Precompiled Micropython ESPNow Images for the ESP32 and ESP8266

A collection of pre-compiled micropython images (including espnow support) for
the esp32 and esp8266.

These are provided as a convenience for users until the ESPNow code is
accepted into a Micropython release.

These images are compiled from the **espnow-g20*** branches at
<https://github.com/glenn20/micropython>.

The Pull Request for ESPNow support is available at:
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/6515>.

Documentation for the ESPNow module can be browsed at:
<https://micropython-glenn20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/espnow.html>.

General micropython documentation at:
<https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/index.html>.

Each folder contains the following firmware images:

- `firmware-esp32-GENERIC.bin`: For the ESP32 GENERIC build target.
- `firmware-esp8266-GENERIC_1M.bin`: For the ESP8266 GENERIC_1M build target
  (1MB RAM devices)
- `firmware-esp8266-GENERIC.bin`: For the ESP8266 GENERIC build target (2+MB
  RAM devices)

These images are built following the instructions at
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md>
and
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp8266/README.md>.

Images can be written to the ESP32 and ESP8266 devices over usb using
esptool.py (install using pip), eg:

```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 write_flash --flash_size=4MB --flash_mode=qio 0 firmware-esp8266-GENERIC_1M.bin
```

or

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware-esp32-GENERIC.bin
```

or

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32s2 --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware-esp32-GENERIC_S2.bin
```

Firmware images are provided in the following folders:
